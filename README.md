Raspberry Pi door bell

As always this will be made with things we have lying around.

* A bell push
* Some CAT5 that goes into the foyet
* RPi
* PiBrella by Pimoroni https://github.com/pimoroni/pibrella 
* An old GPRS / GSM dongle


## The spec

* Door bell makes audible bell noise
* Socket.io based webpage/app for staff volunteers to have running on their PC's / phones to audio alert to a doorbell ring. (This would mean python node bridge which i'm not sure about  https://github.com/evanw/socket.io-python ) might be able to find equivelant . 
* if it rings X times in Y minutes email / sms the call list for the day
